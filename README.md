# microbiology_in_mangroves

Here are proposed the outputs of our work on microbial communities in tidal sediments in mangroves of Cayenne River (Guyane), Martinique, Guadeloupe and Mayotte Islands.

The objective of the program was to set up a protocol in order to test if microbial community parameters answer well to human pressure on surface waters.

Test was successfull and protocol is now deployed in Guadeloupe and Martinique mangroves.

Funded by the Office Français de la Biodiversité, Water Framework Directive (EU).
